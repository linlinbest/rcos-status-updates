Last week, I kept learning html and made a simple webpage. I was able to make the webpage look good, 
but I know I still have problems on dealing with layers. I tried to add an image into the webpage and 
put it under the text, but it seemed the image is automatically put on the top layer and the text was covered by it.
Next week, I'm going to work on solving this problem and learning more html staff. Maybe I can try to code for the easy
parts of our webpage.

  Since I never engaged in webpage building before this project, I had to learn the relative programming language at first. Thus, I learned the basic grammar of the html and got familiar with many frequently used labels (like <a>,<div>) on the first few weeks. Later, I started to learn CSS, and did some coding practices on my own. I tried to design a brief layout for our website while practicing. Meanwhile, I was working with my group members to build the report page for our website.
  Moreover, I also learned to use 4d camera and how to convert the images into the appropriate form for the website. At the last few weeks of the semester, I got started to learn JavaScript. I learned the basic syntaxes and wrote some code in JavaScript for image preloading. I also learned the mechanism of progressively image loading for improving the loading time of images. Thatâ€™s basically what I did this semester.

## Last Week's Accomplishments

I learned some common html labels last week, and started coding in html for getting more familiar with html.

## This Week's Plan

Keep learning html and CSS, and try to build a simple local website.

## Anything Blocking?

Since I just start learning html, I'm still struggling with how to make nice-looking website's layout.

Last week, I made a brief navgating page for our main page and made some changes in main page, like replacing images. next week, I'm going
to add more features in the navigating page. What was blocking our progress was still the 4d images. We don't know how to deal with the
images taken by 4d camera. The images show up as 2 seperate circles while we want them to be rectangular. We'll try to figure out how to do
that.

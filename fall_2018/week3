Last week I helped building the website, and the text part of the website is partly finished. The rest part of texts is really just adding
new titles and links for the goods. Next week, I'm going to keep learning css (I learned a little of it when I learned html) because this 
will help us to make the webpage look better. It's neccessary to learn javascript if you want to the webpage to be dynamic, but it would 
take so long time to learn to use javascript. I just learned that the current CSS version is capable to make simple animations, so I guess
I will just focus on CSS in the following weeks. It should be enough for me to build the website.

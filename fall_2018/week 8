Last week, I fixed some little problems in our main page. Some words on the top of the page was blocked by the navigating bar. Now I made
the words show up below the navigating bar, while the navigating bar stays at the top of the page all the time. Next week, I plan to keep
completing our webpage and fixing problems.

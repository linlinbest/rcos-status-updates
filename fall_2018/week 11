Last week, I was working on the image preloading. The view page in our website requires some time to load images whenever we switch to an 
new image. The implementation of preloading make the load time a bit shorter. I also copied images with lower resolution. These images are
used for loading images progressively, from lower resolution to higher resolution. What I plan to do in the following week is to implement
the function of loading images progressively.

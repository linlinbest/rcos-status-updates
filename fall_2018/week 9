Last week, I went to the Collegiate Store and took photos with my group members together again. We can convert the 4d photos into the right 
format now. Previously, the photos we took were shown in two seperate circles, but now we are able to convert them into a rectangle photo. 
We plan to put the 4d photos in the website, and we are trying to figure out how to make these photos shown in VR form.

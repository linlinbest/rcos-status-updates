Last week, I went to the Collegiate Store and took photos of goods using 4d camera with my group memebers. Since the version of the camera
is kind of old, so we cannot convert the photo into the approriate file type and view photos by using devices with ios system. Therefore, 
we will try to find a Android device later, and then we will also figure out how to put the 4d image into the webpage.
